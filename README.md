spatial-filter-for-dense-EEG-analysis

Spatial filters are time-geometry dependent coeffients, applied to the dense EEG signals


The aim of an spatial filter is to increase the EEG spatial resolution for better diagnosis of brain-maps, and to make a virtual sensor for extraction of neural sources on each area of the brain.

The code contains surface spatial filters in 3 plat directions called Laplacian and tangential electric field

Also, the code contains an optimization function for acquiring the optimum dipole source direction acquired by the LCMV beamformer
